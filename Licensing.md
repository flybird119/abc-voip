The ABC-VoIP application is a fork of the CSipSimple app. As such, ABC-VoIP inherits the same structure and GPLv3 license.

The project is globally compounded of 3 main parts :

  * The ABC-VoIP for of CSipSimple, which is the Java application for Android

There is also additional parts to bring other features such as codec or
encryption.
